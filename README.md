# Pixel C FreeBSD scripts

The tools in our organization attempt to be portable, but there are obstacles
that need to be dealt with on non-Linux systems, such as the installation of
the respective external tools.

Since I use FreeBSD myself, the point of this repo is to help other potential
FreeBSD users keep their build process comfortable. Linux users don't need it,
because the tools all work out of box in there.
